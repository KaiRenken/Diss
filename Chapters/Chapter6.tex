\chapter{Alternative generalizations of the classical Cheeger constant}

\label{Chapter6}

In the introduction of this thesis, we defined the generalization of the classical Cheeger constant which was already introduced by Linial and Meshulam (see \cite{2}) and later independently by Gromov (see \cite{3}). But that notion is not the only way to generalize the classical Cheeger constant and we do not even know if it is the "best" way to generalize it, concerning the information these constants give about the stability of connectedness of simplicial complexes. In Chapter \ref{Chapter2} we saw that there is a close connection between the cosystolic norm of a cochain and the hitting number of a certain family of cycles, so we will use this connection to introduce other notions of the Cheeger constant which attain the same value as our earlier notion on a large family of complexes, but might be easier to determine in certain situations. These other notions were introduced by Kozlov (see \cite{13}).

\section{Alternative definitions of the higher dimensional Cheeger constants}

\begin{defi}\label{definition411}
Let \(X\) be a simplicial complex and \(k\geq 1\). Furthermore, let \(\mathcal{F}\subset C_k(X)\) be a family of cycles, such that their supports are pairwise disjoint (i.e. \(\supp(F)\cap\supp(F')=\emptyset\) for all \(F,F'\in\mathcal{F}\), satisfying \(F\neq F'\)) and let
\[
P(\mathcal{F})\coloneqq\{\varphi\in C^k(X):|\supp(\varphi)\cap\supp(F)|=1\text{ for all }F\in\mathcal{F}\text{ and }\supp(\varphi)\subset\bigcup\limits_{F\in\mathcal{F}}\supp(F)\}
\]
denote the set of all possible choices of one simplex per cycle in the family \(\mathcal{F}\). Then we define
\[
\gamma_{\mathcal{F}}\coloneqq\frac{\min\limits_{\varphi\in P(\mathcal{F})}\|\delta^k(\varphi)\|}{|\mathcal{F}|}
\]
and we call
\[
\gamma_k(X)\coloneqq\min\limits_{\mathcal{F}\in\mathfrak{C}}\gamma_{\mathcal{F}}
\]
the \(k\)-th \textbf{disjoint cycle expansion}\index{Disjoint cycle expansion} of \(X\), where 
\[
\mathfrak{C}\coloneqq\{\mathcal{F}\subset C_k(X):\mathcal{F}\text{ is a family of cycles, }\supp(F)\cap\supp(F')=\emptyset\text{ for all }F,F'\in\mathcal{F}\text{ satisfying }F\neq F'\}
\]
is the collection of all families of cycles in \(C_k(X)\) with pairwise disjoint supports.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}\label{definition412}
Let \(X\) be a simplicial complex and \(k\geq 1\). Furthermore, let \(\mathcal{F}\subset C_k(X)\) be an arbitrary family of cycles and let
\[
P'(\mathcal{F})\coloneqq\{\varphi\in C^k(X):|\supp(\varphi)\cap\supp(F)|\text{ is odd for all }F\in\mathcal{F}\}
\]
Then we define
\[
\rho_{\mathcal{F}}\coloneqq\frac{\min\limits_{\varphi\in P'(\mathcal{F})}\|\delta^k(\varphi)\|}{\tau(\mathcal{F})}
\]
and we call
\[
\rho_k(X)\coloneqq\min\limits_{\mathcal{F}}\gamma_{\mathcal{F}}
\]
the \(k\)-th \textbf{hitting expansion}\index{Hitting expansion} of \(X\), where
\[
\mathfrak{C}\coloneqq\{\mathcal{F}\subset C_k(X):\mathcal{F}\text{ is a family of cycles}\}
\]
is the collection of all families of cycles in \(C_k(X)\).
\end{defi}

\section{Relations to the Cheeger constant}

\begin{prop}\label{proposition411}
Let \(X\) be a simplicial complex and \(k\geq 1\), then we have:
\[
h_k(X)\leq\rho_k(X)\leq\gamma_k(X)
\]
\begin{proof}
Let \(\mathcal{F}\subset C_k(X)\) be a family of cycles with pairwise disjoint supports and \(\varphi\in P(\mathcal{F})\). Then we have \(\varphi\in P'(\mathcal{F})\) and \(\tau(\mathcal{F})=|\mathcal{F}|\) and we immediately get \(\rho_{\mathcal{F}}\leq\gamma_{\mathcal{F}}\), so we have \(\rho_k(X)\leq\gamma_k(X)\). Let now \(\mathcal{F}\subset C_k(X)\) be an arbitrary family of cycles and \(\varphi\in P'(\mathcal{F})\). Then we have \(\langle\varphi,F\rangle=1\) for all \(F\in\mathcal{F}\) so we can use the cycle detection theorem and we get \(\|\varphi\|_{csy}\geq\tau(\mathcal{F})\). This implies \(\|\varphi\|_{exp}\leq\rho_{\mathcal{F}}\) and we have \(h_k(X)\leq\rho_k(X)\).
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

We will now show that the first disjoint cycle expansion (and thus also the first hitting expansion) of the simplex on \(n\) vertices equals the first Cheeger constant whenever \(n\) is not a power of \(2\).

\begin{thm}
Let $n$ not be a power of $2$, then we have:
\[
\gamma_1(\Delta^{[n]})=\rho_1(\Delta^{[n]})=\frac{n}{3}
\] 
\begin{proof}
Since $n$ is not a power of $2$ we can write it as $n=c(2t+1)$. Now consider the staircase graph $G_n(\lambda)$ given by the partition $\lambda=c\cdot\text{cor}(t)$. Since $G_n(\lambda)$ is bipartite we can partition the vertices of $G_n(\lambda)$ as $[n]=A\cup B\cup C$, with $A=\{v_1,\ldots,v_{ct}\}$, $B=\{w_1,\ldots,w_{ct}\}$ and $C=\{x_1,\ldots,x_c\}$, such that $C$ is the set of all isolated vertices and all edges of $G_n(\lambda)$ are contained in $E_{G_n(\lambda)}(A,B)$.\\
Construct a family of edge-disjoint cycles of the vertex set $[n]$ as follows:\\
For all edges $(v_i,w_j)$ satisfying $i+j\leq ct$, such that $(v_{ct-j+1},w_{ct-i+1})$ is not an edge in $G_n(\lambda)$ consider the cycle
\[
C_{ij}\coloneqq\{(v_i,w_j),(v_{ct-j+1},w_{ct-i+1}),(v_i,v_{ct-j+1}),(w_j,w_{ct-i+1})\}
\]
For all edges $e_{ij}=(v_i,w_j)$ satisfying $i+j\leq ct+1$, such that $e'_{ij}=(v_{ct-j+1},w_{ct-i+1})$ is also an edge in $G_n(\lambda)$ (for $i+j=ct+1$ they are equal), the set
\[
D\coloneqq\{e_{ij}, e'_{ij}:i+j\leq ct+1\text{, }e_{ij}\text{ and }e'_{ij}\text{ are edges in }G_n(\lambda)\}
\] can be partitioned into $t$ sets $B_1,\ldots,B_t$, each containing $c^2$ edges:
\[
B_k\coloneqq\{(v_i,w_j):(k-1)c+1\leq i\leq kc\text{, }c(t-k)+1\leq j\leq c(t-k+1)\}
\]
Now, each vertex from $A\cup B$ is only contained in edges from exactly one of the sets $B_k$. This means that for any $l=1,\ldots,c$ and any pair of edges $(v_i,w_j)\in B_{k_1}$ and $(v_{i'},w_{j'})\in B_{k_2}$ ($k_1\neq k_2$) the cycles $\{(v_i,w_j),(v_i,x_l),(w_j,x_l)\}$ and $\{(v_{i'},w_{j'}),(v_{i'},x_l),(w_{j'},x_l)\}$ are edge-disjoint. Furthermore, each set $B_k$ itself is a complete balanced bipartite graph (i.e. a graph in which each of the $c$ vertices from $A$ is adjecent to each of the $c$ vertices from $B$) so we can partition it into $c$ sets $B_k^1,\ldots,B_k^c$, such that all edges in $B_k^l$ are disjoint, for every $l=1,\ldots,c$. Thus, the cycles $\{(v_i,w_j),(v_i,x_l),(w_j,x_l)\}$ are edge-disjoint for all $(v_i,w_j)\in B_k^l$. The family of all these cycles united with the cycles $C_{ij}$ we defined before gives a family of edge-disjoint cycles, such that every edge of $G_n(\lambda)$ is contained in exactly one cycle and every cycle containes exactly one of the edges from $G_n(\lambda)$. Since the number of cycles in this family equals the number of edges in $G_n(\lambda)$ and we know that we have $h(G_n(\lambda))=\frac{n}{3}$ by \cite{1} (Theorem 4.2.) we get $\gamma_1(\Delta^{[n]})\leq\frac{n}{3}$ and by Proposition \ref{proposition411} we have $\gamma_1(\Delta^{[n]})=\rho_1(\Delta^{[n]})=\frac{n}{3}$.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

The proof of the following statement can be found in \cite{6}.

\begin{thm}
Let $k+2$ devide $n$, then we have:
\[
\gamma_k(\Delta^{[n]})=\frac{n}{k+2}
\]
\end{thm}
